[[writing scrap week 32 2025]]


These are some partial notes of how i prepare (and kinfd of do) therapy. 

I take a lot of notes all week. I dictate a lot and then have apple or whatever auto-transcribe. It is functionally accurate with only the occassional baffling transcription error (often due to background noise like shower or an open car window)

Try not to focus on recency bias (notes help with that) 
but also dont be afradid to aok about something fresh even breifly...sometimes something recent and aviaalble emotions can help find an insight

- What do you want to do this week?
