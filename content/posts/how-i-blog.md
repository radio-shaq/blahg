Get comfy.

Try to write. in complete sentences for the thing that shall become a draft. If going to leave messy notes or epxlore, do that in a notes file (and link to it). See also [[writing_process]]

Dim/clear the noise

Listen to music if neccessary. A well-grooved playlist or an ambient album may help

Have a scratchpad or another doucment to jot down random un-related ideas to the task at hand. 

Work for set chunks of time (forest app 25 minutes is  helpful for me).
If struggling, try something else, or perhaps check in on basic needs (food, bathroom, sitting comfort,  mind buzziness, water, etc.)
