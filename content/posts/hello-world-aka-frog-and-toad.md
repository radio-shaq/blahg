Who loves Frog and Toad? I do. My 3 year old does too.
[[frog and toad ranked]]


- TOP
	- A Lost Button
		- fun to read, sweet ending 
	- Cookies
		- good skill to learn (what , in the checklist manifesto by giwande calls a "forcing function")
		- Those cookies look delicious 
	- Alone
		- nice message
	- The Lettter
		- sweet
	- A Surprise
		- sweet
	- Tomorrow
		- useful, and cofjure that cozy  weekend feeling.  
	- Ice Cream 
	- The Garden
- MID

	- The Corner
		- Kind of aimless but harmless . fun to see frog's parents 
	- The Dream 
		- odd story. Did the author just transcribe an actual dream of his?
	- A list
		- actually pretty useful, just a little boring
	- The Kite
		- fine, i guess. the robins aren't very nice. 
	- A Swim
		- everyone is mean to toad. and frog doesn't back him up. so we have to change this one a little.
	- Dragons and Giants
		- eh. Kind of boring . Tries to be edgy?
	- Spring
		- the whole frog gaslighting toad thing isn't great. It does have both "Blah" and "I can't see anything however," and a few other gooes lines ('count the stars etc.,' 'you can counthem' ). id make this one upper mid-tier
	- The Hat
		- more gaslighintg by frog
- BOTTOM
	-  Shivers
		- my 3 year old likes this one. I change the words so it isnt about a giant ghost frog threatening to devour a child frog. instead it just wants to play jumprope (funny, thats what the people who made the 2024 tv show did too.)
	-  Down the Hill 
		- too dangerous
	-  A Story
		- Too much self-destructive behavior by Toad.  Todddler/Preschooler age child wants to replicate (smashing head against wall, stanidng on head, etc.)
	- Christmas Eve
		- saved by the TV adaption. Otherwise I avoid. Gave my 2.5 year old imagery for a nightmare (image of animal)


Notes:
- These are explicitliy for the book versin of the frog and toad stories . in many cases the tv adaption vastly imrpvoed several of the stories. see brlow for my favorite. 

- Criteria for being good:
	- I dont need to change it t omake it safe for a 2-3 year old (looking at you, "A Story")
	- Fun opportunities for silly voices (esp. Toad, and double sepscialyl if he sauys "I cant see anyging" or blah")
	- makes me feel good
	- timeless
	- funny 
	- nothing mean or dated or suggestion violence



- BONUS: Fav TV Episodes:
	- Ice Cream: tom kenny as ice cream selling banjo playing mink. How many blahs and i cant see anythings? lets see, I think theres at least 1 of each. 
	- Spring: its about. a 'blah' from taod a minute at one pooint thin this. a ton of fun  for us 'blah heads out here.   THeres like 10 blahs in this episode. you could say i'm 'blah'gging about this . Bonus its paired with  the adapationm of dragons and guiants, whic in my opioion is much imprved over the book. Dragons and Giants also features the toddler fan favorite phrase 'Hello, Lunch' by the snake.  spring was imprvoed too. frog less manipualtive / gaslighty than in the book
		- blahg.com is a good nomain mname. what about blahg.net[]
